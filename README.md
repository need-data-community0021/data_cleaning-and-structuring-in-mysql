## Introduction
The project focuses on cleaning and structuring large datasets in MySQL using various MySQL functions. Data cleaning is a crucial step in data analysis, where raw data is transformed into a clean and structured format, ready for further analysis. The project will use various MySQL functions to clean data such as SUBSTRING_INDEX(), LEFT(), and TRIM(). These functions can separate, remove, or replace specific parts of the data in columns, making it easier to work with the data.
## Objective
The goal of this project is to use MySQL functions to clean and structure large datasets automatically. By doing this, we can eliminate incorrect, incomplete, or duplicate data, which will improve the quality of the data. The project aims to make data cleaning easier, faster, and more efficient, saving time and resources for organizations.
## Dataset
The dataset used in the project is the *[Uncleaned Laptop Price dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ehtishamsadiq/uncleaned-laptop-price-dataset)*. The dataset contains '278528' rows and 12 columns. Some columns contain mixed values, such as Company name, Cpu, Gpu, ScreenResolution, Memory and OpSys which will be separated into individual columns using appropriate MySQL functions.
## Methodology
**The project will follow the below methodology to clean the data using MySQL functions:**
1. Import the dataset into MySQL using appropriate commands or tools.
2. Identify data quality issues, such as missing or inconsistent data, and develop a plan to clean the data.
3. Use MySQL functions to clean and structure the data, such as separating mixed values into individual columns, removing redundant data, and standardizing data formats and units.
4. Test the cleaning process on a subset of data to ensure accuracy and reliability.
5. Automate the data cleaning process using MySQL functions, making it easy to apply to future datasets.

## Outcome
**The outcomes of the project are as follows:**
- Developed an automated data cleaning process using MySQL functions that can clean large datasets efficiently
- Dataset size reduced from '278528' to '261523' using MySQL functions and methods, improving the accuracy and reliability of the data.
- Separated mixed values in columns, such as full names, into individual columns using MySQL functions, making it easier to work with the data.
- Eliminated redundant and inconsistent data, such as removing duplicate rows and replacing missing data with appropriate values
- Created a well-structured and formatted dataset, suitable for further analysis and reporting.
- Improved data quality and integrity, making it easier to make data-driven decisions.
## Conclusion
The project demonstrates the effectiveness of using MySQL functions to clean and structure large datasets efficiently. The automated data cleaning process developed can save time and resources for organizations, making it easier to extract insights and make data-driven decisions. The project also highlights the importance of data cleaning in ensuring accurate and reliable analysis.
